# Overview

This repository contains the meeting minutes for the RISC-V Virtual Memory task
group, which is currently working on the following tasks:

* Naturally-aligned power-of-two (NAPOT) address translation contiguity
* Attributes (e.g., cacheability) associated with virtual rather than physical
  addresses
* Assorted other updates to the RISC-V virtual memory sections of the RISC-V
  privileged ISA

The documentation is being developed on the (TBD) branch of the
[riscv/riscv-isa-manual](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/)
repository, since it is largely a set of small extensions to the existing
privileged ISA specification.

# Maintainers

The repository is currently being maintained by the chair and vice-chair of
the virtual memory task group: Daniel Lustig, dlustig@nvidia.com, and Ajay
Ingle, Ajay.Ingle@wdc.com.
